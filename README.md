# ProjectVII
The final project I made during my time in the university I attended.

It's a hack n' slash where the order of the combos you execute matter. Each combo triggers an elemental attack.

If you use the right elements at the right order, you can curse enemies with stacks of a debuff that deals damage over time
or you can buff yourself with bonus attack speed and lifesteal on attacks.

To buff yourself use: Wood -> Fire -> Earth -> Metal -> Water -> Wood -> repeat....
To curse enemies: Wood -> Earth -> Water -> Fire -> Metal -> Wood -> repeat....

Keep doing attacks in these orders to increase stacks of buff or debuffs, amplifying their effects up to 5 stacks maximum.
Even if you max out the stacks it's still important to keep the orders right to refresh the duration of the buffs/debuffs.

I loved the idea for this game but in the end we didn't have enough time to properly implement the idea and expand the game 
so it is just a small scene where you fight enemies and can buy a few upgrades from the vendor and that's it.
